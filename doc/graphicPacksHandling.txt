GRAPHIC_PACKS :
=========================================================

BatchFw have an auto-update process of its graphic packs folder (_BatchFW_Graphic_Packs) and check
update availability (when registering new CEMU install). You can force this detection/update by using
the created shortcut : "Wii-U Games\Update my graphic packs to latest.lnk"

If a game is not supported in the Slashiee's repository, BatchFW create a generic one (only resolution scaling).

Those graphic packs are very simple ones compared to Slashiee's ones (only scale without tweaking shaders). 
Except if V2 graphic packs exist (using shader files). In this case, the v3 graphic packs will import those 
files and upgrade them to the V3 syntax (import the double native resolution graphic pack V2 and replace 
    res(X|Y|)Scale = 2.0 by res(X|Y|)Scale = ($width/($gameWidth|gameHeight))

When comes out an official pack, batchFw replace his packs with the official ones automatically 
(during the graphic pack folder auto-update process) and define missing presets for your desired 
aspect ratios (16/10 for example)

If you check on a new game and if the graphic pack is not applied or if you have any issue, the native resolution 
in the BatchFW's internal database might be wrong for this game. Get the true native resolution 
using CEMU UI's feature "/ Debug / View texture cache info" and update the BatchFW's database. 
Also check if the cemu FPS value is correct (speed adjustement (FPS CAP) graphic packs)

If you have to customized a graphic pack (create an user defined one), create it under %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\Cemu\graphicPacks (but as a folder !)

BatchFW use this folder to gather all graphic packs available for a game (V2 + V3, V2 are prefixed with V2_). It creates links (junction)
to its graphic packs folder (_BatchFW_Graphic_Packs). 
Those links are automatically updated (if drive letter change), deleted (broken links) and recreated each time you launch the game.
