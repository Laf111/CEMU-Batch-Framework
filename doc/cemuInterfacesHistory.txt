CEMU INTERFACES HISTORY :
=========================================================

First of all, you need to be aware of the following about CEMU history :

    CEMU 1.8    broke shader cache compatibility -> if you try to import a shader cache on earlier version, it will be erase/reset by CEMU
    CEMU 1.10   add -mlc argument to customize path for mlc01 directory -> in earlier version, all games's data are mixed in mlc01 subfolder in CEMU

    CEMU 1.11   modifying saving process and location : broken compatibility on saves -> use Cemu 1.11 to import/format your saves from previous versions
    CEMU 1.12.1 add disable precompiled shader cache (UI settings & in game's profile)
    CEMU 1.13   add -mlc settings in UI to customize path for mlc01 directory
    CEMU 1.14   introduce V3 graphic packs

Before 1.11, saves are in mlc01/emulatorSave/ShaderCacheId and updates and DLC are applied by overwriting files.
After 1.11, they are stored in mlc01/usr/save/titleId[0:7]/titleId[8:15]/* (where titleId is the 16 characters id of your game (cf http://wiiubrew.org/wiki/Title_database )), 
updates are in mlc01/usr/title/titleId[0:7]/titleId[8:15] 
and DLC are in mlc01/usr/title/titleId[0:7]/titleId[8:15]/aoc

Recommended versions for BatchFw are >=1.11 (to avoid down side save format conversion issues).
Anyway, if you want to use a version erarlier than 1.11, you'd better have a specific Cemu install for those games.

Concerning CemuHook : 
---------------------

Since CemuHook 0.5.6.0 for 1.8.1-1.11.3, appears a new option in Debug menu : 
    - Precompiled shader cache On/Off, in case you want to use only your GLCache (GPU OpenGL cache).

On newer versions (>=1.15), the GLCache is not protected in CEMU's folder under shaderCahce/driver/nvidia
