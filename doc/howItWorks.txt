HOW IT WORKS : 
=========================================================

Assuming that all users (BatchFw users created with each Windows profile) share the same settings on a given host.

When creating shortcuts for a CEMU's version : 

    - if a mlc01 subfolder does not exist in game's folder, batchFw will create one. 
    - controller profiles are copied in CEMU's subfolder

The first time you launch a game for a given CEMU's version, you 'll have to follow a wizard that help you to collect your settings for this game :

    - if a meta\meta.xml is missing, batchFw can creates one for you
    - if no graphic packs is found for this game, create ones for you (V2 and V3 graphic packs). 
    - get game's data from an internal wii-u title database and complete them with game's update version and DLC presence before saving them 
      in a text file under game's folder
    - if a profile file for this game is missing in CEMU, you will create one and save a copy in a _BatchFW_Missing_Profiles folder in order to 
      share it with the others versions of CEMU 
    - batchFw can display the example.ini of this version to helps you to fill the game's profile file with the supported directives
    - you can also choose to browse to another CEMU's install folder to compare game's profiles of this game side by side.
    - batchFw will display the current CEMU and CemuHook settings detected
    - launch CEMU UI a first time to ask you to select you graphic packs, at least all controller profiles for each players to this game
    - settings are saved under the game's folder for the current host under GAME_FOLDER\Cemu\settings\HOSTNAME\CEMU_VERSION\

        
After this wizard completed, all actions are done silently. 
When launching a game (using its shortcut or an executable), launchGame.bat script will :

    - check if an graphic pack update is available
    - if enabled, complete/create graphic packs for this game
    - copy saved settings to CEMU_FOLDER including only the graphic packs of this game
    - load game's saves for current user 
    - creates a 2 levels backup of game's saves
    - provide V2 and V3 graphic packs for this game (using links)
    - copy transferable shader cache to CEMU install
    - creates a 2 level backup of transferable shader cache
    - retore OpenGL Cache fot this game in the GLCache working directory
    - create a lock file in CEMU_FOLDER, launch CEMU with a high priority
    - when closing CEMU : remove lock file and analyse return code to initialize CEMU_STATUS for the game and this CEMU's version
    - if CEMU's return code equal 0, search in compatibility report ot the current host if a row already exist for this game, creates a new one otherwise
    - else, open CEMU's log file
    - search in CEMU's version report for current rig (host) if a row already exist, create a new one otherwise
    - save settings under game's folder for the current hosts
    - restore initial CEMU's graphicPacks subfolder
    - save games's saves for the current user.
    - save the transferable cache.
    - analyse OpenGL Cache Id, detects display driver update, remove obsolete cache and backup the new.
If an issue occurs, batchFw will open its log file.


Compatibility reports are available throught shorcuts created in Wii-U Games\CEMU\Games Compatibility Reports. 
There are saved on your disk, in your games folder under a _BatchFW_Games_Compatibility_Reports subfolder.

BatchFW does not backup game's profiles. Those files are specific to each version of CEMU.

Settings now overrided with the game's profile are saved in the settings.bin on earlier versions.


BatchFW creates logs under_BatchFW_install\logs for your games library and every hosts.
Do not delete this log, it also contain your settings 

With using the tools provided to copy/move mlc01 folder's data for all your games in theirs respectives folders, with versions of CEMU newer 
than 1.11 your CEMU folder will finally contains only its precompiled cache shader (host dependant). 
All game's data (saves, updates, DLC, settings and transferable cache) are in the game's folder.

Your controller profiles are saved under a _BatchFW_Controller_Profiles\USERDOMAIN (USERDOMAIN=host name) and delivered to each version of
CEMU.
