CEMU HISTORY :
=========================================================

    CEMU 1.8    Broke shader cache compatibility -> If you try to import a shader cache on earlier 
                version, it will be erase/reset by CEMU;
    CEMU 1.10   Added -mlc argument to customize path for mlc01 directory -> In earlier version, all 
                games' data were mixed in mlc01 subfolder in CEMU;
    CEMU 1.11   Modified saving process and location: broken compatibility on saves -> Use Cemu 1.11 to 
                import/format your saves from previous versions;
    CEMU 1.12.0 Added games list;
    CEMU 1.12.1 Added disable precompiled shader cache option (UI settings & in game profiles);
    CEMU 1.13   Added -mlc settings in UI to customize path for mlc01 directory;
    CEMU 1.14   Shader reworked and introduced V3 graphic packs;
    CEMU 1.15   Support for game's mods;
    CEMU 1.15.1 iGPU option legacy changed (no legacy by default);
    CEMU 1.15.6 Save controler profile used in the game's profile when using the UI (right click on the 
                game in the list);

Before 1.11, saves were in mlc01/emulatorSave/ShaderCacheId and updates and DLC were applied by overwriting files.
After 1.11, they are stored in mlc01/usr/save/titleId[0:7]/titleId[8:15]/* (where titleId is the 16 characters id 
of your game (cf http://wiiubrew.org/wiki/Title_database )), 

- updates are in mlc01/usr/title/titleId[0:7]/titleId[8:15] 
- and DLC are in mlc01/usr/title/titleId[0:7]/titleId[8:15]/aoc

Recommended versions for BatchFw are >=1.11 (to avoid down side save format conversion issues).
Anyways, if you want to use a version earlier than 1.11, you'd better have a specific Cemu install for those games.

About CemuHook : 
---------------------

Since CemuHook 0.5.6.0 for 1.8.1-1.11.3, appears a new option in Debug menu : 
    - Precompiled shader cache On/Off, in case you want to use only your GLCache (GPU OpenGL cache).

On newer versions (>=1.15), the GLCache is not protected in CEMU's folder under shaderCahce/driver/nvidia
