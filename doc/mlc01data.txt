MIGRATE MLC01 DATA :
=========================================================

BatchFw ties your game's mlc01 data to the game's folder.

- to easily switch between versions of CEMU by having them share: 
    * saves, 
    * updates, 
    * dlcs, 
  by using the -mlc argument; 
- to make your loadiines games library portable (gather all game's data in its mlc01 subfolder);
- to avoid having all data for all your games mixed in the CEMU's folder and prevent from leaving USELESS data 
  when uninstalling a game;

Shortcuts created will use -mlc option pointing to mlc01 game's subfolder (your initial mlc01 folder in your 
Cemu's folder will be untouched)
So you can safely choose the first time to copy your mlc01 CEMU's subfolder (and remove it later if you 
keep BatchFW installed);

But before copying or moving, check your left space on your drives. If you have enough space, we recommend to 
copy the mlc01 folder instead of moving it.

If you want to uninstall BatchFW and have progressed in some games, choose to revert mlc01 from games's folders 
to your CEMU folder in order to keep your last saves created during BatchFW's trial. 
You should also think to choose to revert transferable cache.
