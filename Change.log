======================================================================================================
PLEASE DON'T TOUCH/MOVE FILES UNDER ./LOGS ESPECIALLY HOST_*.LOG BECAUSE THESE FILES ARE USED TO 
SAVED BATCHFW'S SETTINGS FOR EACH HOST USED

IF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY ISSUE, TRY RESET BATCH FW TO FACTORY SETTINGS USING "WII-U GAMES\BATCHFW\RESET BATCHFW.LNK"

Once mlc01 data are moved to game's folder. BatchFw "only" prepare CEMU's workspace.
Issues that could be affected to BatchFw are :
- online files are missing
- saves/games stats not found/saved
- settings missing/not saved
- GFX packs are missing
- no cache found (transferable or GLCache)
Other issues should be related to CEMU itself.

IF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY ISSUE WITH CEMU : 
1) if settings for this version were IMPORTED from another one, try to delete your settings 
   using the dedicated shortcut "wii-u games\cemu\cemu_x.y.z\delete all my cemu_x.y.z's settings.lnk"
2) refuse the import the next run to use the factory settings from this version
3) DISABLE ALL GFX PACKS and check if the issue persist
4) DO NOT REPORT BUGS TO CEMU TEAM (discord or subreddit), CONTACT ME FIRST

15/03/2021 V22-4 :
add : WII-U / check (regExp) on accounts 
add : WII-U / posibility to select all games in ExportSavesToWiiu.bat and importWiiuSaves.bat
add : change Wii-U scrits icons
fix : restoreUserSavesOfAllGames.bat.bat do not ask for account if WiiU ones exists
fix : WII-U / exportSavesToWiiu.bat : in SYNCR mode if an active slot exists, use it instead of CEMU default save
fix : WII-U / remove shutdown option in import/export saves
fix : WII-U / Transfert message in ExportSavesToWiiu.bat
fix : feadback from Cemu2Wii-U 
        The FTP server has an issue : it can't handle files timestamps (dates). I've tried using WinSCP and FileZilla, 
        same date = 01/01/1970
        Injecting "simple" saves (such as "Fast Racing Neo" one) will work but for some games (BOTW, WWHD, MK8...) saves will be 
        invalidated by the Wii-U because of incoherents timestamps (dates) on files. Leading in starting a new save or hanging on 
        the splash screen (MK8)
        The workaround consists in forcing the timestamp to 0 (=01/01/200) : files are injected with this date (0) and so as they 
        are not anteriors to the timestamp value (0) and will not be rejected.
fix : GFX packs completion disabled after a GFX packs folder update
fix : WII-U / remove paste code for sync/keep saves of the Wii-U in getWiiuOnlineFiles.bat

02/03/2021 V22-3 :

add : Wii-U files format conversion script (need JNUSTool setup completed)
      WUD <-> WUX, WUW,WUD -> WUP, WUX, WUD -> RPX, WUP -> RPX      
      if targeted format is RPX : 
      - you can choose to keep the WUP package (for example, add it directly on a SDCard for a future installation on your 
        Wii-U)
      - the game is installed automatically and if an active network is found on the next/first run
        available upadte and DLC will be detected. Use 'Wii-U Games\Update Games.lnk' shortcut to download and install them
        automatically.
add : import new cache (titleId.bin) if old cache (shaderCacheId.bin) is not found (better than nothing for versions
      of CEMU earlier than 1.16)
add : use titleId in gamesLibrary.log to track GFX packs completion status
      Fix some completion status computation failure for some games
add : FPS CAP packs also when FPS++ is detected (BOTW, only sync monitors refresh rates presets)
add : use a game profile template based on last version of CEMU in LaunchGame and WizardFirstLaunch systematically
fix : remove the _BatchFW_Controller_Profiles folder (now using a template for all games)
fix : remove winmerge and the game profile diff step when importing game's profile (simplify wizard process)
fix : shortcuts to en/disable the progress bar are now always created 
      Warning : using the progress bar double the launching times
fix : regression on scaling V2 packs instanciated from existant one

13/02/2021 V21-9 :
opt : reduce launching time (33%)
opt : rework the gfx packs handling : considering now the version of CEMU used to define the range of the GFX pack versions
      to be selected.
      Older packs are completed when needed.

fix : force api = 0 in settings. xml when importing for v < 1.16 from v > 1.16 (Vulkan is not suported)
fix : some issues when launching old version of CEMU with GFX packs V4 and V6 mixed (that is the case in the offcial repository)
fix : Sonic Lost Word FPS cap effect behavior (NOEF) in Wii-U title database

12/02/2021 V21-8 :
hotfix : regression (.exe extension ot found when launching setup, create*.bat) due to a missing declaration
fix : "find error" message when launching Create*.bat with selecting games

03/02/2021 V21-7 :
add : Extra save slots concept to handle multiple saves per user 
      New shortcut in Wii-Games\%BATCHFW_USER%\_BatchFw - Set saves slots.lnk
      (you have to launch shortcuts or excutable creation to create it)
add : Script to set extra slot enabled 
      - list %BATCHFW_USER% games with active slots, 
      - create a new extra slot and activate it
      - activate a given slot
      - delete an existing slot
      - override default's user save with a given slot and deactivate all slots
      - override default's user save with a given slot and delete all slots
      - delete all slots (keep default user's save, the CEMU one)
      - deactivate all slots (use default user's save and do not delete slots)            
add : A readonly file "%GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\Cemu\inGameSaves\%GAME_TITLE%_%user%_activeSlot.txt" define the slot 
      used by the user (so it keeps the information in the game folder in case of uninstalling/re-installing the game)
      Each slot is identified by a number and a label given by the user.
      Each label is written in a file in "%GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\Cemu\inGameSaves\%GAME_TITLE%_%user%_slot%i%.txt" close to 
      the extra save file : "%GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\Cemu\inGameSaves\%GAME_TITLE%_%user%_slot%i%.rar" 
add : Wii-U / now you can choose to synchronize OR keep both saves (CEMU AND Wii-U one)
      If you choose to keep both, BatchFw creates automatically an extra slot when importing saves from the Wii-U. 
      The label is filled automatically with : "WII-U import + %DATE%"
      All import / export operations will use the last modified slot with a label containing "WII-U import"
      (so you can create another slot from this save and it will be used as the last modified slot with its label containing
       "Wii-U import" is picked)
add : documentation (create userSavesAndSlots.txt and modify syncWii-U.txt)
add : Script to select games to be compressed and uninstalled (create a COMPLETE rar archive of each game)
      New shortcut in Wii-Games\Compress and uninstall games.lnk
      (you have to launch shortcuts or excutable creation to create it)
      Archive files contains : game + update + DLC + all saves for all users + transferable cache + all settings used by 
      all users on every host (including controller profiles and mod used)
      The files are created in %GAMES_FOLDER% (and this folder is used as working one). 
      Size left on device is checked before all operations.
      If archive file already exist, it is updated instead of be replaced.
      The backup file is a max compressed RAR 5 (you need RAR 5 support to open it with a GUI) file that have passed the final files check.
      Delete the game's folder only if the operation succeeds (analyse Rar.exe return code) 
      You can choose to turn PC off when done.  
add : Possibility to shutdown PC after all treatments in downloadGames.bat, updateGames.bat, injectGamesToWiiu.bat and dumpGamesFromWiiu.bat

fix : clean dead code in backupInGameSaves.bat
fix : restore the old version of "injectGamesToWiiu.bat" that inject games/updates and DLC that you have 
      previously dumped (will be usefull if eShop goes down definitively one day)

add : in launchGame.bat searching for a transferable cache for API=OpenGL and for Vulkan if CEMU < 1.19
fix : in launchGame.bat clean old update location at the end of the script (this folder is created by links 
      to 00050000e and 00050000c in updateGameGraphicPacks) to avoid red hightlining in CEMU
fix : when opening CEMU for the first time set GAMES_FOLDER as Games Path to avoid CEMU popup on first run
add : compute data size needed only if source and target partitions differs
add : "Fix broken shortcuts.lnk" now also remove shortcuts with invalid CEMU install paths (removed or moved)
fix : created FPS CAP packs also if a 60FPS pack exists (clean code and comments), FPS++ detection remains
add : a column in internal Wii-U title database used for FPS CAP packs : Cap effect (enum = NOEF, SPEED, SYNCSCR)
      - NOEF : NO speed-up, no FPS increase or incompatible or it exists a FPS++ pack
      - SPEED : affect emulation speed
      - SYNCSCR : increase the FPS only
      Values are set by myself using the game dev team (and the game engine they usualy use) otherwise
      Unknown/unchecked games in the database are set to the default value = SYNCSCR 
fix : CAP FPS packs are now created using "SetFps" instead of "Speed" and only for SPEED and SYNCSCR games 
add : save screen refresh rate of every host used
add : a FPS CAP preset to fit refresh rate of all the monitors you use (for each host defined)
      On games where only the FPS is affected (SYNCSCR : emulation speed didn't changed but FPS is increased), 
      it allows to push the FPS close to what your screen can display.

add : replace multiplyLongInteger.bat with multiply.bat (floats support)
add : updating games : remove FPS++/60FPS warning raised when a GFX pack is found for the game
      (those packs used internal memory adresses which could be changed when applying the update and
      so it could break the pack). Considering now this GFX packs are up to date (use the latest
      update).
fix : when searching silently for update/DLC of a game (if an active network connection is on and if
      you have setup JNUSTool), fix false detection of update/DLC that could occurs when the version is
      defined with leading 0 in meta.xml and installing issues

add : WII-U / re-enable the games injection feature
        - remove the checks on Code/title.* files
        - remove dead code for update and DLC files
      HowTo : inject games' files using BatchFw, finish to install games using NUSspli and install update, DLC
      It allows you to inject many games via FTP automatically instead of install WUP packages of each games
      (usefull if you have a "small" SDCard)

fix : dat account file was not installed on the very first launch (in wizardFirstSaving.bat)
      leading in an incomplete installation of online files ONLY the first run

- add : auto-import is now enabled by default
        if installing a version >= 1.15.15, if a user game profile is found => import (CEMU's auto-
            update feature will update the settings.xml file)
        else :
            - if a user's game profile is not found => do not import
            - all requiered nodes must exist in the candidate settings.xml

- opt : clean the code using the results of the new check on bat files (remove all unused labels and fucntions)
- add : a script exportAllToCemu.bat that call 
        - restoreMlc01DataForAllGames.bat
        - restoreTransShadersForAllGames.bat
        - restoreUserSavesOfAllGames.bat

        gamesLibrary.log (to force batchFw will complete the GFX packs on next launch)
- fix : auto-update issue (did not end). Fixed but you'll get an excpeted error 
        "'RLEVEL" when update (due the dynamic patch of the updater source
        file). Just close the windows.
- fix : saves not found for the current user in restoreUserSavesOfAllGames.bat
- fix : importGames.bat always copy even if move was chosen
- opt : lower compression time by using the update mode
- opt : lower significatively pre processing time :

        CEMU's version subfolder under "Wii-U Games\CEMU" 
- add : WII-U / add DLC injection in injectDumpsToWiiu.bat (only update seems to use
        symlinks on Wii-U file system)
- add : WII-U / do not use SaveMii anymore : BatchFw now fully handle saves (import/export)
- add : WII-U / now game stats are handled and updated both ways (CEMU <-> Wii-U) during import/export
        It does not work before because i didn't realize that Wii-U timestamp in saveinfo.xml is an hexa
        number. Converted to decimal, it gives a J2000 timestamp and Cemu uses a 1970 timestamp (like Linux)

        with a popup message) to avoid the CEMU (> 1.16) popup import.
- add : checks on the first run of setup.bat on a given host
       -> try to create a link (used in BatchFw for GFX packs)
       -> check if powershell scripts execution is allowed (policy <> Restricted or AllSigned)
       -> check if the vbs scripts execution is allowed
- add : WII-U / scripts to enable/disable WII-U firmware update and shortcuts
- add : WII-U / a script to inject games'dumps (games you removed from the wii-U) and
        previsouly dumped with BatchFw.
        Due to FTPiiU server limitation it is impossible to recreate symlinks on the 
        WiiU file system remotely => only game is injected (not the update nor the DLC).
        You'll have to update the game and get the DLC from your Wii-U
        Only FULL games dumps are candidates : files title.fst and title.tmd must exist under the 
        code folder of the game.
- add : WII-U / add shortcut for inject dump script in "Wii-u Games\Wii-U"
- add : WII-U / and start/end dumping dates in "_BatchFw_WiiU\gameDownloadHistory.log" and

        "Wii-U Games\BatchFw\Reset BatchFw.lnk")
- fix : Reset BatchFw call to fixBatFiles.bat
- fix : WII-U / dumpGames exit after selecting games'numbers
- fix : WII-U / unexpected check on wiiU IP adress (DOS syntax)
- fix : WII-U / useless warning raised by scanWiiU.bat
- add : WII-U / ask for a SDcard creation when dumping games from the setup.bat (if no games
        were found in setup.bat)
- add : WII-U / dump games script check if an active network connection exists before 
        propose you to update GFX packs folder (if needed)
- add : import games script check if a GFX pack are available for each game imported
        if at least one game has no GFX pack, propose to update the GFX packs folder
- add : import games script call setup.bat if no args are given

opt : lower GFX pack completion time
fix : limit windowed presets and packs to 16/10 and 1366x768
fix : regression setup.bat exit (choice 3) was not taken into account
fix : regression V2 packs not listed in CEMU < 1.14 (links were not created)
fix : update paths/detection compatibility broken for CEMU < 1.15.11 
      (>1.16 move files and break the comptability on update location, DLC is OK since 1.11.6)
      rebuild the old paths (using links) for versions < 1.15.11 

27/01/2020 V15-7 :
fix : migrate games'update and DLC path to new ones (break compatibility with versions
      earlier than 1.11.6) ti avoid 1.17 DLC check on the old location (copy/moveMlc01 scripts
      are not impacted)
fix : update scale factor for 16/10 windowed ratio

fix : remove unused icons built with box art image (save 40Mb on BatchFw)      
fix : multiplyLongInteger error if a custom character (not ISO 850) is in games' path
      (implicit expansion not delayed in for loop)
add : if GFX completion is running and progress bar is used : in launchGame.bat use the
      progress bar to display the message
add : a 0 limit on height in create*GraphicPacks when computing "exotic" custom aspect ratio
      such as 1366x768 -> 863/384
add : WII-U / call to dumGamesFromWiiu.bat in setup.bat when no games were found

- batchFw is now completly silent when launching games and create a log "shortcuted" in Wii-U Games\BatchFw
  On failure, batchFw's log is displayed. When CEMU's return code is <> 0, its log.txt is displayed.
- add : script to monitor BatchFw execution, set launchGame.bat (and all its child processes) priority to high, define a timeout 
  and propose to kill BatchFw if reached.
- use message box instead of cmd console to display messages
- add: ordered programs list to launch before CEMU (DS4, CemuGyro, speed hack ..) only if not already running
  if located in your games library (saving the path using environnement variable to keep portability)

    - Restore executables creation
    - Now in setup.bat (installation and shorctut : "Wii-U Games\BatchFW\Register CEMU installs.lnk")
        - create BatchFw's users : add an optional arg to launchGame.bat allowing to handle multpile saves on a single player's game like BOTW
	- 2 levels of backup is applied to each user's save 
    - Scripts for creating shortcuts or executable loop on users list to create a one more level folder using user's name 
      in "Wii-U Games"
    - Add a script ImportSaves.bat and a shortcut to it in "Wii-U Games\BatchFW\Tools\Games's saves"
    - Automatization of the step need on each CEMU's update in setup.bat and child scripts that create shortcuts and executables : 
        - get CemuHook if not found 
        - launch a first time to download CemuHook's shaderFonts, set REGION and language in CEMU
    - Legacy option support for IGPU  : shortcut's names for CEMU > 1.15 will be suffixed by -Legacy. 
      And with -NoLegacy for earlier versions
    - wizardFirstRun.bat : 
        - dump cemuHook and Cemu settings.xml (if they exists)
        - if CemuHook's timer is different than "Cemu default" check if CEMU's RDTSC timer is disabled in game's profile
          raise a warning otherwise (many games crash otherwise since 1.14)
        - it is now possible to loop on game's profile completion step to finalize it
    - ask fullscreen mode in createShortcuts.bat and createExecutables.bat
    - update embeded graphic pack folder to V320
    - create windowed packs (full screen in windowed mode without streching) also for other aspects ratios than 16/10

11/01/2019 V11-4 : 
    - fix BOTW's graphic pack's preset completion failure (taking heightfix var into account). If the res graphic 
      pack for a game use a heightfix workaround, batchFw will recall you that you have to set it to 1 if black 
      borders appears for the preset you choosen.
      
06/01/2019 V11-3 : 
    - for NVIDIA users only : add the unexpected missing level GLCache in shaderCache\driver\nvidia 

04/01/2019 V11-2 : 
    - for NVIDIA users only : handle a different GLCache working directory for CEMU >= 1.15.1 
      (cache restore/backup process remain the same and still use one cache by game). 
      now it's recommend to install CEMU on C: to keep the move operation instantaneous.
    - add an NTFS volume detection in setup.bat (as it uses symlinks, BatchFw will refuse to be installed 
      on a non NTFS volume)
    - iGPU option noLegacy replaced by Legacy when running CEMU>=1.15.1 ([No legacy] is added to each shortcut's name
      for shortcuts created with CEMU>=1.15.1)
      
27/12/2018 V11-1 : 
    - Now if a new game if added in your library, the mlc01 subfolder is created silently in the game's one.
      If want to launch a version earlier < 1.10 : copy the game's mlc01 subfolder in the Cemu's install
    - update the documentation 
    
22/12/2018 V11 : 
    - add a import Mods script (called in setup.bat) and a shortcut to run it. It ask for a mods source folder and 
      copy all mods folders under each %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\Cemu\mods (in the game concern, by using rules.txt titleId)
    - Rename embeded V2 graphic pack internal names in order to differenciate them on version of CEMU earlier than 1.14
    - add a supplementary level of backup for saves and transferable cache : because the launch following the crash that 
      have corrupted files (when you aknowledge the issue), backup files are replaced (lost) by the corrupt backup.
	- add the possibility to disable graphic pack creation/completion. You still can create graphic packs for a game
	  using the shortcut "Wii-U Games\BatchFW\Tools\Graphic packs\Create game's graphic packs using its titleId.lnk"   

2018/12/12 V10-8 : 
    - complete informations displayed in the consoles
    - remove all flashing CMD consoles due to parallelizing processes
    - create 16/10 windowed graphic packs (or presets in V3) only if user choose to launch CEMU windowed during setup.bat

    - fix errors detected on V2 graphic packs created by BatchFW in createExtraGraphicPacks.bat
    - update embeded V3 graphic packs to v248
    - remove timeout choice on settings items also in createShortcuts.bat
    - create Cemu/mods folder in createShortcuts.bat and invite user to move its mods in
    - uninstall.bat move mods folder founds under game's folder before deleting Cemu subfolder created initially by BatchFw
    
2018/12/05 V10-7-4 : 
    - fix error displayed due to M&SRio2016 graphic packs (& is not allowed for dos expansion)
      Add antRenamer to be used for renaming graphic packs to avoid such issue

2018/12/02 V10-7-3 : 
    - handle mods for games : 
        - save your mods for each game under %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\Cemu\mods they will be linked as graphic packs
        - junction link's name in %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\Cemu\graphicPacks is prefixed with _mod_
    - optimize the createGameGraphicPack script (parallelizing using a new script createV2graphicPacks.bat)
    - launching transferrable cache copy asynchronally and wait its end before launching CEMU (as done for the 
      game's update graphic pack process)
    - add FPS value in the CEMU version's compatibility reports

2018/11/28 V10-7-2 : 
    - fixed : update process broke BatchFw's V3 graphic packs (games not still supported in Slashiee's repo)

2018/11/25 V10-7-1 : 
    - fixed : graphic packs not show in the wizardFirstRun

2018/11/24 V10-7 : 
    - separate V2 and V3 graphic packs to avoid names conflicts and use links instead of duplicate graphic packs for each games
      in %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\Cemu\graphicPacks (V2 graphic packs links are prefixed with V2_). Delete automatically brokens links 
      and update them in case of a changing drive letter (if you have your games library on an USB drive).
    - enhance defaults graphic packs filters V2 & V3
    - trace the last graphic pack version used for the game's (extra) graphic pack creation in the games library log's file
	- fix patching shader files from V2 graphic pack when native resolution of the game is 1080p
    - when launching a game, if no V3 graphic pack found for the game (game not supported in Slashiee repo) launching 
      createGameGraphicPack.bat If at least one V3 pack is found retreive his build version from games library's log file and 
      compare it to the last version downloaded. If different, call createExtraGraphicPacks.bat, delete all broken links under 
      %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\Cemu\graphicPacks and recreate links on newer packs
	- set no to default choice timeout for updating graphic pack folder
    - in setup.bat on the first launch (when BatchFW_readme.txt does not exist), update existing BatchFw tree in game's folder (looking 
      for shaderCache and inGameSaves folder and propose to move it/overwrite in a Cemu subfolder or delete it)
    - added documentation on graphic packs handling
      
2018/11/09 V10-6 : 
    - extend filters number in V3 graphic packs

    - new graphic packs (that not exist in Shlashiee repository yet) are now created with a list of titleId (not only yours)
    - don't create V3 FPS CAP anymore if an FPS++ gp is found (new FPS++ graphic pack define vsync value)

2018/11/06 V10-3 : 
    - add last V2 graphic packs (v100) and v165 v3 ones in _BatchFW_Graphic_Packs.rar
    - move updateMySavedGraphicPacks.bat's call in updateGraphicPacksFolder.bat
    - flush all V3 graphic packs in _BatchFW_Graphic_Packs before updating (as recommended on Slashiee's website) 
    
2018/11/01 V10-2 : 
    - as V3 graphic pack update consist now in overwrite the file (not only replace stock GP as for V2 ones), forcing extra
      graphic pack creation when updating the graphic packs saved for a game (before updating)
    - remove V111 V3 graphic pack from batchFw files
    - "Wii-U Games\BatchFW\Register CEMU installs" shortcut (that call setup.bat in slient mode) also now ask (if needed) to update
      _BatchFW_Graphic_Packs folder
    
2018/10/31 V10-1 : 
    - update graphic pack's URL for auto update process

2018/10/31 V10 : 
    - new saved data architecture : only one "Cemu" folder in game's folder
        -> settings are saved with the relative path Cemu\Settings\!USERDOMAIN!\!CEMU_FOLDER_NAME!
        -> graphicPacks, controllerProfiles are not saved per version of CEMU anymore. Folders are created in 
           Cemu game's sublfolder
    - create extra graphic packs only when launching the wizardFirstSaving.bat 
    - now save graphic packs for a game (not per version of CEMU anymore)

    - force to update saved graphic pack for the game after automatic settings import
    - force to update saved graphic pack after each graphic packs update

2018/10/27 V9-11 : 
    - remove default choices and timeout in setup.bat (and set longer times in createShortcuts.bat)
    - fix non creation of V3 graphic pack for a game supported in V2 but absent from V3 slashiee packages (means that you
      can create V3 graphic packs for games that does not have V3 graphic packs yet and so that you're not be able to 
      play on 1.14 at a different resolution than the native one)
    - fix non working disabling precompiled shader patch in game's profile

2018/10/26 V9-10 : 
    - pre launch optimizations :
        -> ask if more than one user have to be handled in the setup.bat (on the first run only) : it avoid removing save and wait after 
           uncompressing the current user's saves archive
        -> use symbolic links for graphicPacks and shaderCache\transferable CEMU's subfolders (handling the presence of unexpected links
           that could left after closing batchFW's console accidentally as there is no signals handling in batch scripting...)
    - in wizardFirstSaving.bat : fill the graphicPacks subfolder of settings folder with only the 16/9 and user defined ratios graphic packs    
    - move extra graphic pack creation in wizardFirstSaving.bat and keep a createExtraGraphicPacks.bat call in launchGame.bat in the 
      automatic import settings code, to create (if needed) new extra graphic pack in case of new "stocks" graphic packs

    - improve forbidden characters detection : 
        - restrict the forbidden characters list to reserved characters for delayed variable expansion : &,!,%
        - detect and identify unexpected characters not handled by your system's charset (for example japeneese... characters)
    - improve renaming process (when possible)
    - check if cemu.exe is not still running in the background (can happen with crash) to avoid GLCache corruption issues

2018/05/23 V8-2 : 
    - improve detection of forbidden characters in game's folder during setup.bat
    
2018/05/21 V8-1 : 
    - fix automatic import settings always enabled

2018/05/17 V8 : 
    - save one openGL cache per game under C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local^|Roaming\NVIDIA^|AMD\_BatchFW_CemuGLCache\GPU_VENDOR@DRIVERS_VERSION\!GAME_TITLE! 
      as they are drivers dependants, leave them in this folder (erased when doing a full install)
    - ignore precompiled shader cache by default (after timeout)
    - if you chosen a partial drivers install (NVidia), detection of drivers upgrade (using GPU_VENDOR@DRIVERS_VERSION folder'a name)
    - breaking support for versions of CEMU earlier than 1.11 (before -mlc options). 
      these specifics versions might be duplicated for each games you launch with.
      so assume that the version of cemuHook installed is at least 0.5.6.1 (ignoring precompiled shader cache feature is available)  
    - fix a bug when using batchFW without moving mlc01 data in game's folder (game was not launched)
    - update external graphic packs folder to 2-894
    
2018/05/08 V7-3 : 
    - minimized all windows before launching CEMU in order to open it in foreground
    - use only ONE openGL cache for ALL versions of CEMU under C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local^|Roaming\NVIDIA^|AMD\_BatchFW_CemuGLCache
    - add the ignore precompiled shader cache option for each version of CEMU you install (dispatch to all games you play with) 
    - delete deleteAllMyGLCacheBackup.bat, modifiy shortcut in createShortcuts.bat
    - when a CEMU path is no more valid, also delete the shortcut Delete my cemu_X.Y.Z's settings in Wii-U Games\BatchFW\Tools
    - update external graphic packs folder to 2-877

2018/05/03 V7-2 :

    - add support for 4 languages (ENG/GER/SPA/FR) by getting locale for host (used to set default answer to the "terminate process" 
      question when closing a cmd windows with the mouse)
    - update external graphic packs folder to 2-873
    - GLCache saving for each CEMU install for AMD, NVIDIA,... GPU : 
        - OpenGL cache is searched as the first last modified GLCache folder from %USERPROFILE%\appData. So the folder's switches Local/Roaming and AMD/NVidia are handled. 
        - OpenGL cache will be saved under CEMU_FOLDER\_BatchFW_GLCache\GLCache[GPU_VENDOR@DRIVERS_VERSION]\OGLCacheId after CEMU close
        - On launching a game, BacthFW check if a display drivers update was done (comparing versions) : 
            - if a drivers's update is detected, you'll get a popup notification to warn you that BatchFW will try all the same the backup and recommend you to delete all GLCache saved for all version using the new shortcut created for that, if CEMU rebuild also its cache entirely.
            - creation of a link (junction) in %USERPROFILE%\appData\Local|roaming\Nvidia|AMD\GLCache\OGLCacheId to CEMU_FOLDER\_BatchFW_GLCache\GLCache[GPU_VENDOR@DRIVERS_VERSION]\OGLCacheId
        - On closing game : diff the GLCacheId 
            - batchFW get the newOGLCacheId as last modified folder under GLCache.
            - if OGLCacheId changed, batchFW delete the backup in CEMU_FOLDER and save the new cache
            - unlinking junction
    - add a script and a shortcut to delete all GLCache saved : deleteAllMyGLCacheBackup.bat (also called by uninstall.bat)
    - add a script and a shortcut to delete GPU OpenGL Cache.
    - add a script and a shortcut to get all caches's folders sizes of all your CEMU installs.
    - optimize moves : check if data are located on the same drive. If they are, use move command instead of robocopy /MOVE
    - change the way log files are filled : 
            - hostLogFile : removing double quotes in path, enabling its parsing
            - gameLibraryLogFile : always sorted by name (first string in a line is GAME_TITLE)
    - Host's log is now parse to get paths in
    - auto-delete invalid shortcuts that point to non existant CEMU_FOLDER path
    - CEMU_VERSION games compatbility report : add a column containing the row entry format expected when editing "Testing" section for a game @http://compat.cemu.info/

    - updateMySavedGraphicPacks.bat fix
    
2018/04/09 V6-2 : 
    - CEMU graphic pack folder was not clear after closing CEMU
    - create a sortcut to example.ini file for each version
    - now systematically update saves graphic packs with external one (not only when import existing settings)


2018/04/09 V6-1 : 
    - update graphic packs to 2-862 
    - add an argument to setup.bat and a create its shorcut
    - propose to open CEMU's version example.ini file in wizardFirstSaving to set game profile
    - Compatibility reports : fill additionnals notes with game version, dlc, and mostly settings defined in game's profile
    - fix a bug when calling ./tools/getTitleDataFromLibrary.bat directly

2018/04/08 V6 : 
    - update documentation
    - add a systematic saving of emulatorSave files (old saves format) in order to avoid loosing them if you try to play a game (that you used to play on an old version) on a CEMU version newer than 1.11. To revert to your old CEMU version extract the saved file in your original folder (CEMU install one).
    - protect files on read only (to prevent some file editor from changing the encodeing format of files)

2018/04/06 V5-2 : minor fix
    - failed to save game saves and report comptability when not having mlc01 in the game's folder
    - add a subfolder USERDOMAIN in reports folder. Create a folder instead of shortcut for consult report.

2018/04/05 V5-1 : minor fix
    - game profile's shortcut creation was misplaced (move from createShortcuts.bat to launchGame.bat)
      That affect only missing game's profiles in CEMU subfolder. 
    - add a script restoreMlc01DataForAllGames.bat to revert mlc01 data move (usefull only i have moved and not copied mlc01 data)
    - add an uninstall.bat script (calling restoreMlc01DataForAllGames.bat, deleteAllInGameSaves.bat and deleteAllMySettings.bat)
    - rename BatchFW folders (as graphic packs created, with _BatchFW prefix)
    - now synchronised controller Profiles folder between CEMU's version and _BatchFW_Controller_Profiles\USERDOMAIN (host depdendant)
    
    
2018/04/04 V5 : Install Icons automatically, open dialog boxes
    - now only the following characters are forbiden in paths : (,),&,%,£,! and ^
    - improved specials characters support by : 
        getting and setting the char code set of the host
        delay expansion in all code and closing variables visibility
    - open folder browsing dialog boxes
    - save / share controller profiles between all CEMU's version
    - add log files (one for games library and one by host)
    - add shortcuts to edit game's profiles of your games for each versions
    - missings games profiles created by BatchFW are shared by all CEMU's version in a _Missing_Games_Profiles subfolder
    - BatchFW no longer save game profile, for earlier versions than 1.16, new settings (GPU, CPU) are saved throught the settings.bin file
    - install icons automatically for 115 games (no matter the region is)
    - add a setup.bat that display documentation only one time and build BatchFW_readme.txt


2018/03/04 V4 : transferable shader cache moved to game folder to be shared by all host
    - analyse CEMU log after the first launch of the game following the first saving wizard for the game to get its shaderCache Id
    - addvShaderCacheId to the game's description file located under the game's folder
    - handle games's saves for CEMU version earlier of 1.11 (under mlc01/emulatorSave/shaderCacheId)
    - save transferable cache in game folder, checking its name and size :
        After CEMU stop, 4 cases are possibles :  

        When CEMU's transferable cache file and saved cache file have the same name
            1) CEMU's transferable cache file size > saved cache file size : nominal case, overwrite saved by moving CEMU file
            2) saved cache file size > CEMU's transferable cache file size : import a transferable shader file right named (shaderCacheId.bin) 
               or broken compatibility (its what happen if for example you try to import a cache file created with a CEMU version before 1.8 on a 
               newer version)
        CEMU's transferable cache file and saved cache file have differents names : 
            3) CEMU's transferable cache file size > saved cache file size : rename the saved old one, move CEMU file for saving this one
            4) saved cache file size > CEMU's transferable cache file size : case of upgrading a transferable shader file wrong named (its what 
            happen if for example you try to import a cache file created from game with another region), or CEMU\_VERSION change the shaderCacheId

        you'll get a user notification for cases 2, 3 and 4. 
        Files are automatically renamed before backup them.
        A log file indicating DATE, USER, and HOST, CEMU\_VERSION old and new ShaderCache Id ... is created.
    - search now games recursively (you can tidy your data the way you want in a game's folder)
    
2018/03/04 V3-1 : 
    - fix no titleID found on game with name containing '.' 
    - add tutorial video in archive

2018/02/25 V3 : 
    - get GAME version in %MLC01_FOLDER_PATH%\usr\title\%beginTitleId%\%endTitleId%\meta\meta.xml else in %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\meta\meta.xml
    - search if a DLC is installed for the game
    - analyse CEMU return code to set a CEMU_STATUS for the game (only 2 states : "Unplayable" cr != 0, "Loads" otherwise)
    - create/update automatically your own working games database %GAMES_FOLDER%\_Games_Compatibility_Reports\%USERDOMAIN%_working_games_list.csv containing a row per game with :
      Game Title;Cemu Version;OS Version;Region;CPU;GPU;Tester;Status;Additional Notes;title Id;Exist in WiiU-Titles-Library.csv;Game Version;DLC installed;Saves found
    - create/update automatically a %CEMU_VERSION% working games compatibility report %GAMES_FOLDER%\_Games_Compatibility_Reports\%USERDOMAIN%_%CEMU_VERSION%_games_compatibility_list containing a row per game with :
      Game Title;Cemu Version;OS Version;Region;CPU;GPU;Tester;FPS;Status;Additional Notes;title Id;Exist in WiiU-Titles-Library.csv;Game Version;DLC installed;Settings Saved;Saved found
    - those 2 files can be import in Excel and save as xls file to be filtered on each item. 
      Columns 2-10 are those required for [official CEMU's game compatibility list](http://compat.cemu.info/)
      To update a game row in, simply delete the game's row
    - speed up saving game's saves process (launched now in backgrond without waiting after)
      

2018/02/20 V2-1 : fix and improve robustness with forbidden characters 
2018/02/18 V2 : 
    - insure CEMU's thread safing for BatchFW launches using a lock file created in CEMU's folder containing date, user and last game launched
    - add multi-user game's save support : using windows login : %USERNAME%
      assuming every user share all CEMU's settings
        * add backupAllInGameSaves.bat (replace backupInGameSaves.bat that now is called systematically by launchCemuGame.bat 
          to update %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\inGameSaves\%GAME_TITLE%_%USERNAME%.zip after closing CEMU)
        * when launching game, %GAME_TITLE%_%USERNAME%.zip is extracted into %MLC01_FOLDER_PATH%
        * backupAllInGameSaves.bat simply copy inGameSaves\%GAME_TITLE%_%USERNAME%.zip to inGameSaves\%GAME_TITLE%_%USERNAME%_%DATE%.zip
    - add updateMySavedGraphicPacks.bat to update graphic packs stored in CEMU settings of each game with _Graphic_Packs content
      (graphic packs are updated only if they're found in the 2 folders)
    - launchCemuGame.bat also update graphic packs saved in the settings folder for the game when importing existing 
      settings from an other CEMU's version (older one generally)
    - add GPUBufferCacheAccuracy in the game profile if not found (otherwise saving GPUBufferCacheAccuracy won't work)
    - FIX a bug in backupInGameSaves.bat : compression was made not recursively (missing 'r' argument to rar.exe)
    - add titleId troubles handling in getTitleDataFromLibrary.bat and createGraphicPacks.bat : 
      if no meta.xml file is found CEMU give a titleId BEGINNING with ffffffff
      if titleId found in meta.xml is not corresponding with the CEMU's one (what happen when overwriting game's file with a DLC 
      instead of installing it at the right place in the mlc01 folder) CEMU give a titleId ENDING with ffffffff
    - tidy BatchFW shortcuts by category

2018/02/13 V1-2 : 
    - add a script to create commonly used CEMU's graphic packs for a game given its titleId (can be used alone)
      Each graphic pack created define many filters in order to work for all games (because every game might have 
      a different native resolution)
    - wizardFirstSaving (called only the first time to create settings for a game) now list
      availables graphic packs OR create missing ones automatically (after asking you to update them 
      from https://slashiee.github.io/cemu_graphic_packs/)
    - in order to reduce CEMU's loading time (>30s), handle an external graphic pack folder under _Graphic_Packs
      scripts work also if you decide to keep yout graphic pack under CEMU's folder.
    - move files to a _CEMU_Batch_Framework subfolder
    - move shortcuts created for BATCH framework in BatchFW subfolders
    - create shortcuts for BATCH framework'tools : 
        copyMlc01DataForAllGames.bat
        createGraphicPacks.bat
        deleteAllInGameSaves.bat
        deleteAllMySettings.bat
        getTitleDataFromLibrary.bat
        moveMlc01DataForAllGames.bat            
    
2018/02/09 V1-1-1 : 
    - add a script to get game's data (such as description, productCode, companyCode but mostly REGION of game) 
      from internal resource database using its titleId. Called in wizardFirstSaving.bat (that now save a text file 
      with game name in the game's folder containing those informations) and can be used alone (get user input throught 
      DOS console in this case)

2018/02/07 V1-1 : 
    - change icons
    - relative paths in zip files (inGameSaves)
    - convertIconsForAllGames.bat rename JPG file with GAME_TITLE

2018/02/05 V1-0-1 : 

    - fix a bug on mlc01 folder handling. Now uses /mlc01/usr/*/*/titleid
    - add backupInGameSaves.bat

2018/02/01 V1-0   : First packaged version
