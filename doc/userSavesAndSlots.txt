BatchFw's user saves and extra slots handling : 
=========================================================

1°) Default user save :
-----------------------

Before v1.15.19, CEMU handle only one account (80000001 = one user). 

When launching 'Wii-Games\Set BatchFw settings and register CEMU installs.lnk' or directlty setup.bat
you'll be asked to create BatchFw's users.
If you don't, a defaut user will be created using your Windows' profile name.

In BatchFw, all users defined use in fact the default account 80000001 (that ensure the compatibility with versions < v1.15.19)

Saves are stored under %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\Cemu\inGameSaves\%GAME_TITLE%_%BFW_USER%.rar

NOTES : 
    - like the packages created when you use 'Wii-U Games\Compress and uninstall games.lnk' you'll need an archive manager that 
      supports RAR5 compression to open them under windows.
    - when you launch a game for the first time and when another user have a save available, you'll be asked to use it or not.

    
2°) Extra slot concept :
------------------------

It allows BatchFw's users to handle multiple save for a same game.

Some games (like BOTW) have to few saves slots.
With BatchFw you'll be able to create as many saves as you like.

The principle is simple : 
- When you create a slot, you'll be asked to give an initial slot (0 for duplicating the default save) and a description (label)
- 3 files are created under %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\Cemu\inGameSaves
    * %GAME_TITLE%_%BFW_USER%_slot%SLOT_NUMBER%.rar (archive file) 
    * %GAME_TITLE%_%BFW_USER%_slot%SLOT_NUMBER%.txt (containing a short description you entered)
  and a file %GAME_TITLE%_%BFW_USER%_activeSlot.txt containing the relative path to the archive file of the active slot
- if the file %GAME_TITLE%_%BFW_USER%_activeSlot.txt does not exist => the default save is used 
  %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\Cemu\inGameSaves\%GAME_TITLE%_%BFW_USER%.rar

3°) Available shortcuts : 
-------------------------

%BFW_USER%\_BatchFw - set extra slots saves.lnk : call "setExtraSavesSlots.bat %BFW_USER%"

    Handle extra slots of %BFW_USER%.
    You can :
        - create a new extra slot and activate it
        - activate a slot
        - delete an existing slot
        - override default's user save with a given slot and deactivate all slots
        - override default's user save with a given slot and delete all slots
        - delete all slots (keep default user's save) 
        - deactivate all slots (use default user's save and do not delete slots) 
      

4°) Use in others scripts : 
---------------------------

- restoreUserSavesOfAllGames.bat : this script will continue to use the last modified save files for each users (slots or 
  default user's save files)

- importSaves.bat : will ask if you want to manage/create slot(s) for each games. If you don't, you can choose to overwrite the 
  defaut user's save or not. If you choose to overwrite, a backup is created anyway (as !GAME_TITLE!_!currentUser!_Cemu_!DATE!.rar)
  If you choose to create a new slot, it will be activated.

- importWiiuSaves.bat : add a parmeters is added in host log file WII-U_SAVE_MODE to keep both CEMU and Wii-U saves.
In this mode, BatchFw will try to find an existing slot defined with a label containing "Wii-U import" 
and use it. If not found : 
* if a default user save exists : it will create automatically a slot labelled "Wii-U import @DATE" and activate it (use it)
* no CEMU saves exists for the user: the Wii-U save will become the CEMU one (without creating a slot for this game)
  
- exportSavesToWiiu.bat : will search to use an existing slot with label containing "Wii-U import"
  If not found, will use the last save (default one or a slot) used (last modified date).

- launchGame.bat : will search for the slot file indicated in activeSlot.txt (active slot) and popup 5sec the number and label of the 
  slot used. Otherwise it will use the default save (like before)
