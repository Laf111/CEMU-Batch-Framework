---------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL : 
---------------------------------------------------------

    Extract the archive's contain in your loadiine's games folder, then go in _BatchFW_Install and launch Setup.bat
    
    On the first install, you can display this documentation and the BatchFW_readme.txt file is build.
    Then setup.bat will run in SILENT mode. 
    
    When answering questions in setup.bat, a log file for your current host is created under _BatchFW_Install.
    Never delete this file! It contains your host's settings (fullscreen mode, desired aspect ratio, GLCache path...)
    
    During the setup, you'll define an ouput (shortcut or executables) folder for all the CEMU's installs to use but also: 
        - check and update _BatchFW_Graphic_Packs folder;
        - browse to a folder containing mods for your games so they will be copied under each game's folder;
        - if you want to run CEMU in fullscreen or in windowed mode;
        - if you let BatchFw completes your graphic packs (GFX) presets (V3) or create intermediates packs (V2);
        - your desired diplay aspect ratios (only if you has chosen the previous option);
        - the number of users to create (each user uses his own saves when launching his shortcut);
        - to define an ordered list of third party software (DS4windows, CemuGyro, SepeedHack...) to launch before CEMU in 
          the order defined after checking if the program is not already running;
        - use externals mlc01 paths to copy/move saves, updates and DLC under each game's folder;
        - use your CEMU's mlc01 subfolder as well;
    
    Once the setup is finished, the output folder is opened in a windows explorer. 
    It contains:
        - shortcuts to BatchFw logs, readmes and tools ;
        - a CEMU folder that contains a subfolder for each version registered containing:
            * a shorctut for editing the log of this version (log of the last launch);
            * a shortcut to the script that deletes your settings for this version and each games (selected);
            * a gameProfiles sufolder containing shortcuts to edit example.ini and the profile files of your games
          and also a shortcut to delete settings for all your games and for all versions of CEMU you have registered.    
    
    Note: this folder contains only links or useless data and can be deleted to be fully recreated).
    
    
    RECOMMENDATIONS: 
    
    To be fully functional BatchFw needs that you register the last(s) version(s) of CEMU you used to play your games.            
    If you're using more the one version of CEMU (on version per game for example) register all installations and select 
    the games to associated with those versions.
    
    Once your shortcuts are created, please launch all your games one time to let BatchFw copy the transferable cache 
    into each game's folder.
             
    If you're using one version of CEMU per player (and handle differents saves this way) : register this version for one user
    and use the shortcut "Wii-U Games\BatchFW\Tools\Games's saves\Import Saves" to import saves for other users afterward.    
    
---------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE : 
---------------------------------------------------------

    Delete 
        - _BatchFW_Graphic_Packs 
        - _BatchFW_Install folder
        - also your Wii-U Games folder (containing batchFw's shortcuts)
    Extract archive contains in your loadiine's games folder and launch setup.bat (same process as install)

---------------------------------------------------------
USE : 
---------------------------------------------------------
    
    You don't need to manually open CEMU UI to play your game anymore. 
    Once you have collected all the settings (on the first launch of a game) for all versions of CEMU you play on, use the shortcuts 
    on your desktop (Or your shortcuts folder).

    You want to create shortcuts to all your games for versions of CEMU using the ones created after the installation on your desktop?:

        "Wii-U Games\BatchFW\Create CEMU's shortcuts for selected games.lnk" for a single CEMU version;
        "Wii-U Games\BatchFW\Set BatchFw settings and register CEMU installs.lnk" for more than one version (call setup.bat 
        in silent mode);

    You want to :
        - change the way how Cemu is launched?: delete the shortcuts and re-create them;
        - delete your settings for version X.Y.Z or you want to recreate them?: use "Wii-U Games\CEMU\cemu_X.Y.Z\Delete my cemu_X.Y.Z's settings.lnk";
        - add a game?: 
            * use "Wii-U Games\Import Games with updates and DLC.lnk" to browse to a folder that contains games, updates and DLC
              BatchFW will ties all new games in your games folder with installing their updates and DLC in each game's folder
            * once new games copied in your games folder, create shortcuts for those games
        - remove a game from your library?: simply delete its created shortcut (BatchFw's broken shortcuts appear as the others ones, but without icon);

    With BatchFw, to backup fully a game (saves + update + DLC + transferable cache + controller settings...) just compress your game's folder
        
    Since V11, "how to" informations are displayed in the console when creating shortcuts.
    
    BatchFW come with an embeded graphic pack folder (_BatchFW_Graphic_Packs) created during setup.bat
    It checks for a graphic packs update availability (on eSlashiee repository) and update its packs  
    Only graphic packs of the games you use are kept in _BatchFW_Graphic_Packs and in CEMU UI only the one for the game launched are displayed
    
    There's a specific documentation detailling graphic packs handling in BatchFW.
    
    Your open GLCache is backuped under %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming OR local\%GPU_VENDOR%\_BatchFW_CemuGLCache per game,for all your game and 
    for all GPU users.
    
    If you run an NVIDIA GPU, you can choose to disable automatically the precompiled cache for all your games (batchFw will patch CemuHook 
    files and CEMU's game profile)
    So you go only with your GPU cache, saving space on your device by not duplicating the compiled shaders cache and making it compatible 
    with all version of CEMU.
    This cache is valid unless you update your display's drivers : no need to fully recompile each cache for each game on each CEMU's version
    like when using the precompiled shader cache)
    When you update your drivers, batchFW will automically detect the new cache to backup and remove the old one.

    Disabling precompiled cache is not proposed to AMD's GPU because of their 64Mo size cache limitation. But the GLCache is even backuped.
    
    If you run an iGPU (Intel graphics), you will be asked to use the -noLegacy CEMU's option (-Legacy if CemuW 1.15)

    AUTOMATIC_IMPORT : 
    
    When creating shortcuts, you'll be asked to enable or not automatic settings import. 
    In this mode, if you have already saved settings for this game with another version, you won't need to re-enter your settings for the new
    version. It wil use the settings of the last version used to play the game.
    
    This settings is disabled by default. 
    Enable it only when you know that no changes was done on the settings handled between the 2 versions.
    If you don't know, leave it at disabled (default).
    
    If you enable automatic import and have the single issue, delete the shortcut and recreate it whith disabling the automatic import 
    before report any issue on CEMU's reddit or discord

    WARNING : Do not delete log files created under ./logs 
    If you need to reset BatchFw to default, use the shortcut "Wii-U Games\BatchFW\Reset BatchFw.lnk"
