1°) Common GFX packs folder and update process
----------------------------------------------

BatchFw has an auto-update process for its graphic packs folder (_BatchFW_Graphic_Packs) and therefore autmoatically checks
updates availability. You can force this detection/update by using the shortcut "Wii-U Games\Update my graphic packs to latest.lnk",
or force them to be re-donwloaded with "Wii-U Games\BatchFw\Tools\GraphicPacks\Force to update my graphic packs to latest.lnk".

Note that only graphic packs needed for your games are installed when CEMU is launched

This GFX packs folder is shared with all version of CEMU.
BatchFw embeded the last official version of outdated packs (V2 and V4).

If you lanch CEMU < 1.14 : V2 packs are used (v100)
1.14 <= CEMU < 1.21      : V4 packs are used (v703 if not found a most recent)
CEMU >= 1.21             : V6 packs are used (if no V6 pack is available and a V4 pack is found, it will be used) 

If during the setup you allow BatchFw to complete the GFX packs, it will complete existing packs (official ones) and creates ones for games with no packs available.
It will creates all missing presets for your aspect ratio (for every host you use).

During the setup, BatchFw compute your aspect ratio with your current screen resolution.
So it will work whatever the display configuration you use.

The resolution packs created by BatchFw are automatically replaced by the official ones when they'll be available in the offcial repository.

Also, BatchFw create FPS CAP packs to control the emulation speed on games that use a dynamic FPS engine such as : Mario Kart 8, DKTF, Wind waker...
They are created only if no FPS++ and/or a 60FPS is/are found.


2°) Resolution GFX pack created for unsupported game
----------------------------------------------------

The resolution packs are very simple since they are build automatically.

The internal database contains native resolution and FPS of Wii-U games (used to create GFX and FPS packs)

If on a new game graphics packs are not applied or if you have any issue, THE NATIVE RESOLUTION 
in BatchFW's internal database MIGHT BE WRONG for this game. 

> Get the actual native resolution using CEMU's feature in the "/ Debug / View texture cache info" menu and 
update BatchFW's database. 

Also check if the cemu FPS value while in game (not in cutscene) is correct (for speed adjustement (FPS CAP) graphic packs) compared to BatchFW's database value set by default.
Update BatchFW's database value is needed.


3°) User graphic packs
----------------------

If you have customized graphic packs, create them under %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\Cemu\graphicPacks.

BatchFW uses this folder to gather all graphics packs available for a game (V2 or V3). Then creates links (junction)
to its graphic packs folders (_BatchFW_Graphic_Packs). 

Those links are automatically updated (if drive letter changes), they are deleted and recreated each time you launch the game.

This to ensure your games library portability as WINDOWS links does not truly handle relative path for the target 
(the drive letter might change if you have your games on an external USB drive)
