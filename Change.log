        - create BatchFw's users : add an optional arg to launchGame.bat allowing to handle multpile saves on a single player's game like BOTW
	- 2 levels of backup is applied to each user's save 
    - Scripts for creating shortcuts or executable loop on users list to create a one more level folder using user's name 
      in "Wii-U Games"
    - Add a script ImportSaves.bat and a shortcut to it in "Wii-U Games\BatchFW\Tools\Games's saves"
    - Automatization of the step need on each CEMU's update in setup.bat and child scripts that create shortcuts and executables : 
        - get CemuHook if not found 
        - launch a first time to download CemuHook's shaderFonts, set REGION and language in CEMU
    - Legacy option support for IGPU  : shortcut's names for CEMU > 1.15 will be suffixed by -Legacy. 
      And with -NoLegacy for earlier versions
    - wizardFirstRun.bat : 
        - dump cemuHook and Cemu settings.xml (if they exists)
        - if CemuHook's timer is different than "Cemu default" check if CEMU's RDTSC timer is disabled in game's profile

      borders appears for the preset you choosen.
      
06/01/2019 V11-3 : 
    - for NVIDIA users only : add the unexpected missing level GLCache in shaderCache\driver\nvidia 

04/01/2019 V11-2 : 
    - for NVIDIA users only : handle a different GLCache working directory for CEMU >= 1.15.1 
      (cache restore/backup process remain the same and still use one cache by game). 
      now it's recommend to install CEMU on C: to keep the move operation instantaneous.
    - add an NTFS volume detection in setup.bat (as it uses symlinks, BatchFw will refuse to be installed 
      on a non NTFS volume)
    - iGPU option noLegacy replaced by Legacy when running CEMU>=1.15.1 ([No legacy] is added to each shortcut's name
      for shortcuts created with CEMU>=1.15.1)
      
27/12/2018 V11-1 : 
    - Now if a new game if added in your library, the mlc01 subfolder is created silently in the game's one.
      If want to launch a version earlier < 1.10 : copy the game's mlc01 subfolder in the Cemu's install
    - update the documentation 
    
22/12/2018 V11 : 
    - add a import Mods script (called in setup.bat) and a shortcut to run it. It ask for a mods source folder and 
      copy all mods folders under each %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\Cemu\mods (in the game concern, by using rules.txt titleId)
    - Rename embeded V2 graphic pack internal names in order to differenciate them on version of CEMU earlier than 1.14
    - add a supplementary level of backup for saves and transferable cache : because the launch following the crash that 
      have corrupted files (when you aknowledge the issue), backup files are replaced (lost) by the corrupt backup.
	- add the possibility to disable graphic pack creation/completion. You still can create graphic packs for a game
	  using the shortcut "Wii-U Games\BatchFW\Tools\Graphic packs\Create game's graphic packs using its titleId.lnk"   

2018/12/12 V10-8 : 
    - complete informations displayed in the consoles

      Add antRenamer to be used for renaming graphic packs to avoid such issue

2018/12/02 V10-7-3 : 
    - handle mods for games : 
        - save your mods for each game under %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\Cemu\mods they will be linked as graphic packs
        - junction link's name in %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\Cemu\graphicPacks is prefixed with _mod_
    - optimize the createGameGraphicPack script (parallelizing using a new script createV2graphicPacks.bat)
    - launching transferrable cache copy asynchronally and wait its end before launching CEMU (as done for the 
      game's update graphic pack process)
    - add FPS value in the CEMU version's compatibility reports

2018/11/28 V10-7-2 : 
    - fixed : update process broke BatchFw's V3 graphic packs (games not still supported in Slashiee's repo)

2018/11/24 V10-7 : 
    - separate V2 and V3 graphic packs to avoid names conflicts and use links instead of duplicate graphic packs for each games
      in %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\Cemu\graphicPacks (V2 graphic packs links are prefixed with V2_). Delete automatically brokens links 
      and update them in case of a changing drive letter (if you have your games library on an USB drive).
    - enhance defaults graphic packs filters V2 & V3
    - trace the last graphic pack version used for the game's (extra) graphic pack creation in the games library log's file
	- fix patching shader files from V2 graphic pack when native resolution of the game is 1080p
    - when launching a game, if no V3 graphic pack found for the game (game not supported in Slashiee repo) launching 
      createGameGraphicPack.bat If at least one V3 pack is found retreive his build version from games library's log file and 
      compare it to the last version downloaded. If different, call createExtraGraphicPacks.bat, delete all broken links under 
      %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\Cemu\graphicPacks and recreate links on newer packs
	- set no to default choice timeout for updating graphic pack folder
    - in setup.bat on the first launch (when BatchFW_readme.txt does not exist), update existing BatchFw tree in game's folder (looking 
      for shaderCache and inGameSaves folder and propose to move it/overwrite in a Cemu subfolder or delete it)
    - added documentation on graphic packs handling

      graphic pack creation when updating the graphic packs saved for a game (before updating)
    - remove V111 V3 graphic pack from batchFw files
    - "Wii-U Games\BatchFW\Register CEMU installs" shortcut (that call setup.bat in slient mode) also now ask (if needed) to update

    - remove default choices and timeout in setup.bat (and set longer times in createShortcuts.bat)
    - fix non creation of V3 graphic pack for a game supported in V2 but absent from V3 slashiee packages (means that you
      can create V3 graphic packs for games that does not have V3 graphic packs yet and so that you're not be able to 
      play on 1.14 at a different resolution than the native one)
    - fix non working disabling precompiled shader patch in game's profile

2018/10/26 V9-10 : 
    - pre launch optimizations :
        -> ask if more than one user have to be handled in the setup.bat (on the first run only) : it avoid removing save and wait after 
           uncompressing the current user's saves archive
        -> use symbolic links for graphicPacks and shaderCache\transferable CEMU's subfolders (handling the presence of unexpected links
           that could left after closing batchFW's console accidentally as there is no signals handling in batch scripting...)
    - in wizardFirstSaving.bat : fill the graphicPacks subfolder of settings folder with only the 16/9 and user defined ratios graphic packs    
    - move extra graphic pack creation in wizardFirstSaving.bat and keep a createExtraGraphicPacks.bat call in launchGame.bat in the 
      automatic import settings code, to create (if needed) new extra graphic pack in case of new "stocks" graphic packs
      were added in Slashiee repository

	- automatic import mode disabled by default
    - the graphic packs used and stored in settings folder are now filtered with only the desired aspect ratios
    - update documentation : 
        -> remove references to executables ouputs, 
        -> precise import settings limitation and workaround in case of issue
        -> graphic pack creation, use in batchFW
    - in uninstall.bat : 
        -> if at least one mlc01 folder is found in games library, ask to remove all mlc01 game's subfolders (No by default)    
        -> if at least one shaderCache folder is found in games library, ask to remove all shaderCache game's subfolders (No by default)  


2018/10/16 V9-9 : 
    - support for V3 graphic packs : 
        -> gathering V2 & V3 graphic packs for the game
        -> complete/create resolutions and CAP FPS graphic packs (V2 and V3)
    - add a control in launchGame.bat that check if it is not already launched
    - when settings are imported, patching files for disabling precompiled cache before launching winMerge
    - modify CEMU's log shortcut (does not open notepad.exe anymore) : link directly to the file and so it will be openned with your text 
      editor and you can access to cemu's install folder with a right click / open containing folder
    - ask screen mode during setup.bat (default after timeout is fullscreen)
    - reduce pre and post processings times :
        -> parallelize treatments
        -> use fnr.exe also for patching game's profile and cemuhook.ini (instead of using powershell script for replacing in files)	
    - create restoreTransShadersForAllGames.bat and add a shortcut to it in Wii-U Games\BatchFW\Tools\Shaders Caches
    - uninstall.bat : add a call to restoreTransShadersForAllGames.bat

    - add an argument to createExtraGraphicPacks.bat to be launched per game.
    - modify fps cap graphic pack creation : 
        - for a 30FPS native game with a FPS++ pack provided, only create 150, 200% graphic pack (to speed-up menus for those games)    
        - for a 30FPS native games without FPS++ provided : 110, 120 and 150% cap graphic packs     
        - for a 60FPS native games : 105, 110 and 120 % cap graphic packs

    - improve forbidden characters detection : 
        - restrict the forbidden characters list to reserved characters for delayed variable expansion : &,!,%
        - detect and identify unexpected characters not handled by your system's charset (for example japeneese... characters)
    - improve renaming process (when possible)
    - check if cemu.exe is not still running in the background (can happen with crash) to avoid GLCache corruption issues

2018/05/23 V8-2 : 
    - improve detection of forbidden characters in game's folder during setup.bat
    
2018/05/21 V8-1 : 
    - fix automatic import settings always enabled

2018/05/17 V8 : 
    - save one openGL cache per game under C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local^|Roaming\NVIDIA^|AMD\_BatchFW_CemuGLCache\GPU_VENDOR@DRIVERS_VERSION\!GAME_TITLE! 
      as they are drivers dependants, leave them in this folder (erased when doing a full install)
    - ignore precompiled shader cache by default (after timeout)
    - if you chosen a partial drivers install (NVidia), detection of drivers upgrade (using GPU_VENDOR@DRIVERS_VERSION folder'a name)
    - breaking support for versions of CEMU earlier than 1.11 (before -mlc options). 
      these specifics versions might be duplicated for each games you launch with.
      so assume that the version of cemuHook installed is at least 0.5.6.1 (ignoring precompiled shader cache feature is available)  
    - fix a bug when using batchFW without moving mlc01 data in game's folder (game was not launched)
    - update external graphic packs folder to 2-894
    
2018/05/08 V7-3 : 
    - minimized all windows before launching CEMU in order to open it in foreground
    - use only ONE openGL cache for ALL versions of CEMU under C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local^|Roaming\NVIDIA^|AMD\_BatchFW_CemuGLCache
    - add the ignore precompiled shader cache option for each version of CEMU you install (dispatch to all games you play with) 
    - delete deleteAllMyGLCacheBackup.bat, modifiy shortcut in createShortcuts.bat
    - when a CEMU path is no more valid, also delete the shortcut Delete my cemu_X.Y.Z's settings in Wii-U Games\BatchFW\Tools
    - update external graphic packs folder to 2-877

2018/05/03 V7-2 :

    - delete /b in start call for launching CEMU (foreground)

2018/05/02 V7-1 : 
    - fix a bug that disable compatibility reports update
    - add a default value to "yes" with 6s timeout for flushing the GLCahe in createShortcuts.bat

2018/04/29 V7 : 
    - automatic import is now disable by default
    - add support for 4 languages (ENG/GER/SPA/FR) by getting locale for host (used to set default answer to the "terminate process" 
      question when closing a cmd windows with the mouse)
    - update external graphic packs folder to 2-873
    - GLCache saving for each CEMU install for AMD, NVIDIA,... GPU : 
        - OpenGL cache is searched as the first last modified GLCache folder from %USERPROFILE%\appData. So the folder's switches Local/Roaming and AMD/NVidia are handled. 
        - OpenGL cache will be saved under CEMU_FOLDER\_BatchFW_GLCache\GLCache[GPU_VENDOR@DRIVERS_VERSION]\OGLCacheId after CEMU close
        - On launching a game, BacthFW check if a display drivers update was done (comparing versions) : 
            - if a drivers's update is detected, you'll get a popup notification to warn you that BatchFW will try all the same the backup and recommend you to delete all GLCache saved for all version using the new shortcut created for that, if CEMU rebuild also its cache entirely.
            - creation of a link (junction) in %USERPROFILE%\appData\Local|roaming\Nvidia|AMD\GLCache\OGLCacheId to CEMU_FOLDER\_BatchFW_GLCache\GLCache[GPU_VENDOR@DRIVERS_VERSION]\OGLCacheId
        - On closing game : diff the GLCacheId 
            - batchFW get the newOGLCacheId as last modified folder under GLCache.
            - if OGLCacheId changed, batchFW delete the backup in CEMU_FOLDER and save the new cache
            - unlinking junction
    - add a script and a shortcut to delete all GLCache saved : deleteAllMyGLCacheBackup.bat (also called by uninstall.bat)
    - add a script and a shortcut to delete GPU OpenGL Cache.
    - add a script and a shortcut to get all caches's folders sizes of all your CEMU installs.
    - optimize moves : check if data are located on the same drive. If they are, use move command instead of robocopy /MOVE
    - change the way log files are filled : 
            - hostLogFile : removing double quotes in path, enabling its parsing
            - gameLibraryLogFile : always sorted by name (first string in a line is GAME_TITLE)
    - Host's log is now parse to get paths in
    - auto-delete invalid shortcuts that point to non existant CEMU_FOLDER path
    - CEMU_VERSION games compatbility report : add a column containing the row entry format expected when editing "Testing" section for a game @http://compat.cemu.info/

2018/04/19 V6-3 :

    - now synchronised controller for CEMU_VERSION when importing settings fro a game
    - restoreMlc01DataForAllGames.bat mlc01 level fix
    - updateMySavedGraphicPacks.bat fix
    
2018/04/09 V6-2 : 
    - CEMU graphic pack folder was not clear after closing CEMU
    - create a sortcut to example.ini file for each version
    - now systematically update saves graphic packs with external one (not only when import existing settings)


2018/04/09 V6-1 : 
    - update graphic packs to 2-862 
    - add an argument to setup.bat and a create its shorcut
    - propose to open CEMU's version example.ini file in wizardFirstSaving to set game profile
    - Compatibility reports : fill additionnals notes with game version, dlc, and mostly settings defined in game's profile
    - fix a bug when calling ./tools/getTitleDataFromLibrary.bat directly

2018/04/08 V6 : 
    - update documentation
    - add a systematic saving of emulatorSave files (old saves format) in order to avoid loosing them if you try to play a game (that you used to play on an old version) on a CEMU version newer than 1.11. To revert to your old CEMU version extract the saved file in your original folder (CEMU install one).
    - protect files on read only (to prevent some file editor from changing the encodeing format of files)

2018/04/06 V5-2 : minor fix
    - failed to save game saves and report comptability when not having mlc01 in the game's folder
    - add a subfolder USERDOMAIN in reports folder. Create a folder instead of shortcut for consult report.

2018/04/05 V5-1 : minor fix
    - game profile's shortcut creation was misplaced (move from createShortcuts.bat to launchGame.bat)
      That affect only missing game's profiles in CEMU subfolder. 
    - add a script restoreMlc01DataForAllGames.bat to revert mlc01 data move (usefull only i have moved and not copied mlc01 data)
    - add an uninstall.bat script (calling restoreMlc01DataForAllGames.bat, deleteAllInGameSaves.bat and deleteAllMySettings.bat)
    - rename BatchFW folders (as graphic packs created, with _BatchFW prefix)
    - now synchronised controller Profiles folder between CEMU's version and _BatchFW_Controller_Profiles\USERDOMAIN (host depdendant)
    
    
2018/04/04 V5 : Install Icons automatically, open dialog boxes
    - now only the following characters are forbiden in paths : (,),&,%,£,! and ^
    - improved specials characters support by : 
        getting and setting the char code set of the host
        delay expansion in all code and closing variables visibility
    - open folder browsing dialog boxes
    - save / share controller profiles between all CEMU's version
    - add log files (one for games library and one by host)
    - add shortcuts to edit game's profiles of your games for each versions
    - missings games profiles created by BatchFW are shared by all CEMU's version in a _Missing_Games_Profiles subfolder
    - BatchFW no longer save game profile, for earlier versions than 1.16, new settings (GPU, CPU) are saved throught the settings.bin file
    - install icons automatically for 115 games (no matter the region is)
    - add a setup.bat that display documentation only one time and build BatchFW_readme.txt


2018/03/04 V4 : transferable shader cache moved to game folder to be shared by all host
    - analyse CEMU log after the first launch of the game following the first saving wizard for the game to get its shaderCache Id
    - addvShaderCacheId to the game's description file located under the game's folder
    - handle games's saves for CEMU version earlier of 1.11 (under mlc01/emulatorSave/shaderCacheId)
    - save transferable cache in game folder, checking its name and size :
        After CEMU stop, 4 cases are possibles :  

        When CEMU's transferable cache file and saved cache file have the same name
            1) CEMU's transferable cache file size > saved cache file size : nominal case, overwrite saved by moving CEMU file
            2) saved cache file size > CEMU's transferable cache file size : import a transferable shader file right named (shaderCacheId.bin) 
               or broken compatibility (its what happen if for example you try to import a cache file created with a CEMU version before 1.8 on a 
               newer version)
        CEMU's transferable cache file and saved cache file have differents names : 
            3) CEMU's transferable cache file size > saved cache file size : rename the saved old one, move CEMU file for saving this one
            4) saved cache file size > CEMU's transferable cache file size : case of upgrading a transferable shader file wrong named (its what 
            happen if for example you try to import a cache file created from game with another region), or CEMU\_VERSION change the shaderCacheId

        you'll get a user notification for cases 2, 3 and 4. 
        Files are automatically renamed before backup them.
        A log file indicating DATE, USER, and HOST, CEMU\_VERSION old and new ShaderCache Id ... is created.
    - search now games recursively (you can tidy your data the way you want in a game's folder)
    
2018/03/04 V3-1 : 
    - fix no titleID found on game with name containing '.' 
    - add tutorial video in archive

2018/02/25 V3 : 
    - get GAME version in %MLC01_FOLDER_PATH%\usr\title\%beginTitleId%\%endTitleId%\meta\meta.xml else in %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\meta\meta.xml
    - search if a DLC is installed for the game
    - analyse CEMU return code to set a CEMU_STATUS for the game (only 2 states : "Unplayable" cr != 0, "Loads" otherwise)
    - create/update automatically your own working games database %GAMES_FOLDER%\_Games_Compatibility_Reports\%USERDOMAIN%_working_games_list.csv containing a row per game with :
      Game Title;Cemu Version;OS Version;Region;CPU;GPU;Tester;Status;Additional Notes;title Id;Exist in WiiU-Titles-Library.csv;Game Version;DLC installed;Saves found
    - create/update automatically a %CEMU_VERSION% working games compatibility report %GAMES_FOLDER%\_Games_Compatibility_Reports\%USERDOMAIN%_%CEMU_VERSION%_games_compatibility_list containing a row per game with :
      Game Title;Cemu Version;OS Version;Region;CPU;GPU;Tester;FPS;Status;Additional Notes;title Id;Exist in WiiU-Titles-Library.csv;Game Version;DLC installed;Settings Saved;Saved found
    - those 2 files can be import in Excel and save as xls file to be filtered on each item. 
      Columns 2-10 are those required for [official CEMU's game compatibility list](http://compat.cemu.info/)
      To update a game row in, simply delete the game's row
    - speed up saving game's saves process (launched now in backgrond without waiting after)
      

2018/02/20 V2-1 : fix and improve robustness with forbidden characters 
2018/02/18 V2 : 
    - insure CEMU's thread safing for BatchFW launches using a lock file created in CEMU's folder containing date, user and last game launched
    - add multi-user game's save support : using windows login : %USERNAME%
      assuming every user share all CEMU's settings
        * add backupAllInGameSaves.bat (replace backupInGameSaves.bat that now is called systematically by launchCemuGame.bat 
          to update %GAME_FOLDER_PATH%\inGameSaves\%GAME_TITLE%_%USERNAME%.zip after closing CEMU)
        * when launching game, %GAME_TITLE%_%USERNAME%.zip is extracted into %MLC01_FOLDER_PATH%
        * backupAllInGameSaves.bat simply copy inGameSaves\%GAME_TITLE%_%USERNAME%.zip to inGameSaves\%GAME_TITLE%_%USERNAME%_%DATE%.zip
    - add updateMySavedGraphicPacks.bat to update graphic packs stored in CEMU settings of each game with _Graphic_Packs content
      (graphic packs are updated only if they're found in the 2 folders)
    - launchCemuGame.bat also update graphic packs saved in the settings folder for the game when importing existing 
      settings from an other CEMU's version (older one generally)
    - add GPUBufferCacheAccuracy in the game profile if not found (otherwise saving GPUBufferCacheAccuracy won't work)
    - FIX a bug in backupInGameSaves.bat : compression was made not recursively (missing 'r' argument to rar.exe)
    - add titleId troubles handling in getTitleDataFromLibrary.bat and createGraphicPacks.bat : 
      if no meta.xml file is found CEMU give a titleId BEGINNING with ffffffff
      if titleId found in meta.xml is not corresponding with the CEMU's one (what happen when overwriting game's file with a DLC 
      instead of installing it at the right place in the mlc01 folder) CEMU give a titleId ENDING with ffffffff
    - tidy BatchFW shortcuts by category

2018/02/13 V1-2 : 
    - add a script to create commonly used CEMU's graphic packs for a game given its titleId (can be used alone)
      Each graphic pack created define many filters in order to work for all games (because every game might have 
      a different native resolution)
    - wizardFirstSaving (called only the first time to create settings for a game) now list
      availables graphic packs OR create missing ones automatically (after asking you to update them 
      from https://slashiee.github.io/cemu_graphic_packs/)
    - in order to reduce CEMU's loading time (>30s), handle an external graphic pack folder under _Graphic_Packs
      scripts work also if you decide to keep yout graphic pack under CEMU's folder.
    - move files to a _CEMU_Batch_Framework subfolder
    - move shortcuts created for BATCH framework in BatchFW subfolders
    - create shortcuts for BATCH framework'tools : 
        copyMlc01DataForAllGames.bat
        createGraphicPacks.bat
        deleteAllInGameSaves.bat
        deleteAllMySettings.bat
        getTitleDataFromLibrary.bat
        moveMlc01DataForAllGames.bat            
    
2018/02/09 V1-1-1 : 
    - add a script to get game's data (such as description, productCode, companyCode but mostly REGION of game) 
      from internal resource database using its titleId. Called in wizardFirstSaving.bat (that now save a text file 
      with game name in the game's folder containing those informations) and can be used alone (get user input throught 
      DOS console in this case)

2018/02/07 V1-1 : 
    - change icons
    - relative paths in zip files (inGameSaves)
    - convertIconsForAllGames.bat rename JPG file with GAME_TITLE

2018/02/05 V1-0-1 : 

    - fix a bug on mlc01 folder handling. Now uses /mlc01/usr/*/*/titleid
    - add backupInGameSaves.bat

2018/02/01 V1-0   : First packaged version
